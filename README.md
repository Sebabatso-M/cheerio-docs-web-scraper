![Image](/image/i.png)

## Description

Opens the Cheerio documentation website and saves the documentation pages as pdfs

### Reason for project

I am planning to start with using Cheerio for web scraping so I needed the documentation.

I have limited access to the internet hence I needed the documentation for offline reading.

**SO I DECIDED TO SCRAPE THE WEBSITE ╰(*°▽°*)╯**

### Enjoy this, great learning experience
